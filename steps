Assumptions:

1. The distance between the two sensors is not more than the width of the body passing through. This width is called zone.

This means that there are 3 triggers
a. Sensor1 has triggered but Sensor2 is normal. This is when body enters the zone from either side
b. Sensor2 has triggered while Sensor1 is still triggered. This is when the body has fully covered the entire zone
c. Sensor1 goes to normal but Sensor 2 is still triggered. This is when the body is leaving the other side


2. If the state where both sensors are not triggered does not occur, ignore count because something very thin (like a hand of leg) triggered it.

3.
